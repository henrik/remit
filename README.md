**Remit** is a web app for commit-by-commit code review of GitHub repositories. A modern, live UI thanks to AngularJS and message\_bus.

It's super easy to set up on a free Heroku instance.

Keeps track of what has been reviewed and links to GitHub commits for the actual review.

Also tracks comments on commits.

### Demo

Review the Remit commits using Remit:

<https://remit-on-remit.herokuapp.com/?auth_key=demo>

Please keep in mind that it's meant to be [used within Fluid.app](#use-with-fluidapp) so you get a GitHub panel on the side.

### Why commit-by-commit review?

If you think truly continuous integration and delivery (perhaps with feature flags) is important, you may prefer not to work with pull requests as a rule.

If you don't work with pull requests, commit-by-commit review is what you get. It has some benefits and some downsides compared to review by pull request.

### The name

* <b>Re</b>view com<b>mit</b>s
* Dictionary meanings like
  * "an item referred to someone for consideration"
  * "forgive (a sin)"

## Development

Assumes you have
  * Ruby 2.1.4
  * Bundler
  * Redis

Run:

    bundle
    bin/rake db:setup

    # In a background tab (since it'll run in the foreground),
    # unless it's already running.
    redis-server

    bin/rails server

Visit <http://localhost:3000>

### Fake incoming webhooks

    rake dev:commits N=3   # 3 new commits from GitHub
    rake dev:comments N=3  # 3 new comments from GitHub
    rake dev:deploy        # Heroku says it deployed

### Import a production DB into dev

    # One-time setup
    heroku addons:add pgbackups:auto-month  # Free

    # Every time you want to import
    rake dev:db

You may need to exit local Rails consoles and servers to avoid an error about DB being in use.

### See what a full payload looks like

See `db/seeds/push.json` (commits) and `db/seeds/commit_comment.json` (comments).


## Test

    # In a background tab (since it'll run in the foreground),
    # unless it's already running.
    redis-server

    # Full suite
    rake

    # Only Ruby tests, skip JS unit tests
    rake spec

    # Only JS unit tests (Jasmine in a headless browser)
    # Yes, you need to provide the RAILS_ENV: https://github.com/searls/jasmine-rails/issues/121
    RAILS_ENV=test rake spec:javascript

    # The same JS unit tests in a headful browser
    # Assumes you've started a dev server with bin/rails server
    open http://localhost:3000/specs


## Production

### Set the app up on Heroku

We assume you have a [Heroku](http://heroku.com) account.

    # Customize this. It must be unique and will be your Heroku subdomain.
    HEROKU_NAME="remit-SOMETHING-UNIQUE"

    # No customizations required below

    heroku create $HEROKU_NAME

    AUTH_KEY=`ruby -rsecurerandom -e "puts SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64"`
    WEBHOOK_KEY=`ruby -rsecurerandom -e "puts SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64"`

    heroku config:set AUTH_KEY=$AUTH_KEY WEBHOOK_KEY=$WEBHOOK_KEY SECRET_KEY_BASE=`rake secret`

    # DB. Free plan with max 10,000 rows.
    heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev

    # For message_bus. Free plan, 30 MB.
    heroku addons:create rediscloud:30

    heroku addons:create deployhooks:http --url=https://$HEROKU_NAME.herokuapp.com/heroku_webhook?auth_key=$WEBHOOK_KEY

    git push heroku master
    heroku run rake db:schema:load

If you want to use [Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io) for exception tracking, also do

    heroku config:set HONEYBADGER_API_KEY=your_key_as_provided_by_honeybadger

You need to customize that key, of course.

### Configure the webhook on GitHub

Working at [Barsoom](http://barsoom.se)? [We've got you covered.](https://github.com/barsoom/servers/wiki/Automatically-apply-webhooks-to-all-our-repos)

Not so fortunate? In the settings for any repo you want to use this with, add a webhook:

    Payload URL:   https://remit-SOMETHING-UNIQUE.herokuapp.com/github_webhook?auth_key=MY_WEBHOOK_KEY
    Content type:  application/json
    Let me select individual events:  [x] Push  [x] Commit comment

Where `MY_WEBHOOK_KEY` is whatever you assigned above (see it again with `heroku config:get WEBHOOK_KEY`).

If you just set the app up with the instructions above, you can get the URL into your clipboard like this on OS X:

    echo https://$HEROKU_NAME.herokuapp.com/github_webhook?auth_key=$WEBHOOK_KEY | pbcopy && echo "Copied: `pbpaste`"

### Reload clients automatically

To reload clients automatically when you deploy to Heroku, change the version number in `config/application.rb`.

If you've set up a Heroku deploy webhook per the instructions above, it will be called after deploy and generate a [message\_bus](https://github.com/SamSaffron/message_bus) message with the new version number. That message causes clients to reload if they're running a different version.

### Import reviewed state from Hubreview

Did you use our predecessor [Hubreview](https://github.com/joakimk/hubreview)?

Run this in a Heroku console in the Hubreview repo:

```
json = Revision.where(reviewed: true).pluck(:name, :in_review_at, :created_at, :review_time).map { |n,ra,ca,rt| { sha: n, at: ((ra || ca) + rt.to_i).to_i } }.to_json; nil
File.write("tmp/json", json)
`scp tmp/json you@your-server`
```

And this in Remit:

```
`scp you@your-server:json tmp/json`
raw = File.read("tmp/json"); raw.length
data = JSON.parse(raw); data.first
data.each { |x| Commit.where(sha: x["sha"]).where("reviewed_at IS NULL").update_all(reviewed_at: Time.at(x["at"])) }
```

### Remove old data automatically

Running out of space on the free Heroku DB plan? See `app/models/remove_old_commits_and_comments.rb`.


## Use with Fluid.app

Remit is intended to be used side-by-side with a GitHub pane.

This is sadly not possible with regular frames or iframes, as GitHub doesn't allow embedding. But it can be achieved with [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/).

Fluid.app is for OS X. Please do contribute instructions for other platforms.

* Install [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/). You can use Homebrew: `brew cask install fluid`
* Launch Fluid.app, create a new app:
  * The URL should be `http://github.com`.
  * Use any name and icon you like. It defaults to the GitHub icon.
  * Let it launch the app.
* Open your app's preferences and configure it like this:
  * Whitelist:
    * Allow browsing to any URL
  * Panel Preferences:
    * [X] New windows automatically display visible Panels from previous window
    * Panel split divider style: thin (a purely aesthetic choice; may need a restart of the app to kick in)
  * The first of the two "Browsa" panels:
    * Enter the Remit URL as home page, including the `auth_key` parameter. E.g. `https://remit-SOMETHING-UNIQUE.herokuapp.com/?auth_key=MY_AUTH_KEY`
    * Navigation bar: is always hidden
    * Clicked links open in: current tab in current window
* In the "Panels" menu, select the first Browsa panel to show it
* Drag the divider until it looks good
* In the "Remit" menu, choose "User Agent > Google Chrome" (otherwise GitHub may disable certain features, like commenting on a specific line)

Remit will automatically remove the `target="_blank"` from links when Fluid.app is detected, so "current tab in current window" does the right thing.

There have been reports of issues with GitHub inside Fluid.app (e.g. not being able to write line comments) on OS X Mountain Lion. If you have those issues, upgrade to OS X Mavericks or later.

### API

There is an API:

`/api/v1/unreviewed_commits?auth_key=something` gives you JSON data like

```
{
  count: 123,
  oldest_timestamp: "2015-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  oldest_age_in_seconds: 12345,
}
```

suitable e.g. for displaying on a dashboard.
